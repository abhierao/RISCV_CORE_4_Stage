# RISC-V Workshop

### A guide to Design a Microprocessor in 5 Days

# Overview 
RISC-V is a free and open ISA enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration. Born in academia and research, RISC-V ISA delivers a new level of free, extensible software and hardware freedom on architecture, paving the way for the next 50 years of computing design and innovation.

"Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours" is a Workshop offered by [VLSI System Design](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com) and [Redwoord EDA](https://www.redwoodeda.com/) to help students, computer architect enthusiasts and hobbyists to get a jumpstart into the world of RISCV.

# Workshop Outline 
The workshop was designed to be a 5 day coursework enabling participants to understand the Software-Hardware integration in architecting a Processor core.

The first two days was focussed on how an application written in higher level language (C, C++, JAVA, Python) communicates with the processor, details such as how a compiler / assembler works, interfaces between the Application layer --> OS and RTL, An introduction to RISC V ISA. 

Day3-5 was all about Computer Architecture, RISCV ISA and Impelmenting a 3 stage pipelined RISCV Core on [Makerchip IDE](https://www.makerchip.com/) using [TL-Verilog](https://tl-x.org/)

#### Key Takeaways - 
  - Understanding Compiler/Assembler and its importance
  - How an Assembly program works on a processor. 
  - RISCV ISA.
  - Computer Architecture
  - TL Verilog (An alternative to Verilog and Sys V).
  - Logic Design and RTL Design.
  - Makerchip IDE(An EDA tool used to design the RISC V Core).
